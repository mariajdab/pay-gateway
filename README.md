# Pay-gateway

### Overview

This project attempt to create online payment platform to help e-commerces businesses. To show a 'real' process, we will have two servers opened: one for Bank simulation, related to bank responses, for example, to create a new transaction for card/account or validate a card information; the other server is related to the payment platform, it should be able to process payments, retrieve past payment linked to a txnUUID and make refunds.

### API Endpoints Payment Platform 

###### Process a Payment: 
##### [POST] http://localhost:8080/processor-pay/payments

Example of a valid request body: 
```
{
  "billing_amount": 150,
  "currency": "USD",
  "card_info": {
    "number": "377673221487787",
    "cvv": "110",
    "exp_date": "2025-03-26"
  },
  "crated_at": "2024-03-26T21:50:01.000Z",
  "merchant_code": "1234#",
  "customer_data": {
    "first_name": "lula",
    "last_name": "Rodriguez",
    "email": "ma@ula.ve",
    "address": "las amaricas",
    "country": "MEX"
  }
}
```

### Note: 

The data should be "almost valid" 

  1. The `card number` format is validated (you could use a card number generator online), `cvv` have length equal to 3, `expiration card` should be a date 

  2. The customer or card owner information is also validated: `email` should have a valid format, `first name` and `last name` with a max of 10 and 12, `address` max leght of 18 and `country` shoud have alpha3Code format, for example: MEX, COL, BRA, etc

  3. At the moment the payment platform only accept USD as `currency` and with a minimum amount of `0.01`

Response example: 

```
{
  "status_payment": "Success",
  "txn_uuid": "6fc49459-81a3-4d00-a163-1356171cf10e"
}
```


###### Retrieve a Payment: 
##### [GET] http://localhost:8080/processor-pay/payments/:merchant_code/:txn_uuid

  "customer_data": {
    "first_name": "lula",
    "last_name": "Rodriguez",
    "email": "ma@ula.ve",
    "address": "las amaricas",
    "country": "MEX"
  }
}
```


###### Refund a Payment:

  "reason": "the txn is already refunded"
}
```

## Starting ðŸš€

git clone https://github.com/mariajdab/pay-gateway.git

### Open a new terminal window 
Copy and run the command ```docker-compose up --build```

#### What happened!? ðŸš€
The merchants table needs some entries so the `init.sql` will run to add 2 merchants to the db in order to be able to use the api endpoints 
```
INSERT INTO merchants (name, code, account)
VALUES ('tienda-1', '1234#', 'sjlgjljsg934t93tial');
INSERT INTO merchants (name, code, account)
VALUES ('levis', '33342#', '242598fjslflj9320xd');
````
The server for the payment gateway will be enabled and also the server that represents the bank simulation
